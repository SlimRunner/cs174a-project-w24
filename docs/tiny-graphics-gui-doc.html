# Controls_Widget
```javascript
class Controls_Widget
```
Allows the user to control and interact with `Components`. Each panel provides interactive elements, such as buttons
with key bindings, live readouts of `Component` data members, etc. A `Controls_Widget` adds a horizontal row of DOM
panels to the document, one per loaded `Component` object that's affecting a given canvas.
```javascript
constructor( component, options = {} )
```
Pass in the outer `Component` object that owns the canvas. Child components of it used for animation will be found by
`Controls_Widget` and represented as HTML panels.

# Keyboard_Manager
```javascript
class Keyboard_Manager
```
`Keyboard_Manager` maintains a running list of which keys are depressed. You can map combinations of shortcut keys to
the provided callback functions they should trigger by calling `add()`. See `add()`'s arguments. The shortcut list is
indexed by strings, conveniently showing each bound shortcut combination.
```javascript
constructor( target = document, callback_behavior = ( callback, event ) => callback( event ) )
```
A new `Keyboard_Manager` object is ready to use without any additional work. Optionally pass in `target`, which is the
desired DOM element that should capture key events. Optionally pass in `callback_behavior`, which will be called for
every key action to allow extra behavior on each event -- giving an opportunity to customize their bubbling,
preventDefault, and more. It defaults to no additional behavior besides the callback itself on each assigned key action.
```javascript
add( shortcut_combination, callback = () => {}, keyup_callback = () => {} )
```
Creates a keyboard operation. The argument `shortcut_combination` expects an array of strings that follow standard
JavaScript `KeyboardEvent` key names. Both the keyup and keydown callbacks for any key combo are optional.

# Code_Manager
```javascript
class Code_Manager
```
`Code_Manager` breaks up a string containing code (any ES6 JavaScript) for syntax highlighting and display purposes. The
regular expression being used to parse JavaScript code is from https://github.com/lydell/js-tokens

Note: The source above states the following limitation of the regex: "If the end of a statement looks like a regex
literal (even if it isnâ€™t), it will be treated as one." (It can miscolor lines of code containing both divisions and
end-of-line comments).
```javascript
constructor( code )
```
Pass in any string of JavaScript code. The `Code_Manager` will give itself members `tokens` and `no_comments`, which are
arrays that respectively contain every token and every non-comment token. A token has both a `type` and a `value`. The
former is for categorizing which type of JavaScript syntax it is; the latter is the actual content.

# Code_Widget
```javascript
class Code_Widget
```
`Code_Widget` draws a DOM element containing a code navigator panel, with colorful syntax highlighting and with inline
links to the entire program source code. Clicking a linked class definition brings up that source code instead.
`Code_Widget` considers all definitions that exist within the namespaces called `tiny` and `defs` when converting
identifier names into links.
```javascript
constructor( component, options = {} )
```
Pass in the `Component` that owns the document section this widget appears inside of. Option `code_in_focus` selects
which source code class, method, or function to display. Option `hide_navigator` hides the table of links to all
known code definitions appearing in namespaces `tiny` and `defs`.
```javascript
display_code( code_in_focus )
```
Populate the code textbox. Pass `undefined` to choose index.html's source as the code to display.

# Editor_Widget
```javascript
class Editor_Widget
```
Currently does not work offline. This class is for submitting modified class definitions to online hosted repositories
of tiny-graphics demos. The button to refresh the demo with updated code is currently non-working.  Under construction.
```javascript
constructor( component, options = {} )
```
Pass in the `Component` that owns the document section this widget appears inside of. Option `rows` determines the
maximum amount of rows in the input before line wrapping. Option `code_in_focus` selects which source code class,
method, or function to display.
```javascript
select_class( class_definition )
```
Populates the editor textbox with an existing definition from source.
```javascript
fetch_handler (url, body)
```
A general utility function for sending / receiving JSON, with error handling.  This function demonstrates a generally
useful technique for handling network requests for JSON data.
