Controls_Widget

class Controls_Widget

Allows the user to control and interact with Components. Each panel provides interactive elements, such as buttons with
key bindings, live readouts of Component data members, etc. A Controls_Widget adds a horizontal row of DOM panels to the
document, one per loaded Component object that's affecting a given canvas.

constructor( component, options = {} )

Pass in the outer Component object that owns the canvas. Child components of it used for animation will be found by
Controls_Widget and represented as HTML panels.

Keyboard_Manager

class Keyboard_Manager

Keyboard_Manager maintains a running list of which keys are depressed. You can map combinations of shortcut keys to
the provided callback functions they should trigger by calling add(). See add()'s arguments. The shortcut list is
indexed by strings, conveniently showing each bound shortcut combination.

constructor( target = document, callback_behavior = ( callback, event ) => callback( event ) )

A new Keyboard_Manager object is ready to use without any additional work. Optionally pass in "target", which is the
desired DOM element that should capture key events. Optionally pass in "callback_behavior", which will be called for
every key action to allow extra behavior on each event -- giving an opportunity to customize their bubbling,
preventDefault, and more. It defaults to no additional behavior besides the callback itself on each assigned key action.

add( shortcut_combination, callback = () => {}, keyup_callback = () => {} )

Creates a keyboard operation. The argument "shortcut_combination" expects an array of strings that follow standard
KeyboardEvent key names. Both the keyup and keydown callbacks for any key combo are optional.

Code_Manager

class Code_Manager

Code_Manager breaks up a string containing code (any ES6 JavaScript) for syntax highlighting and display purposes. The
RegEx being used to parse JavaScript code is from https://github.com/lydell/js-tokens

Note: The source above states the following limitation of the regex: "If the end of a statement looks like a regex
literal (even if it isnâ€™t), it will be treated as one." (This can miscolor lines of code containing both divisions and
EOL comments).

constructor( code )

Pass in any string of JavaScript code. The Code_Manager will set its members tokens and no_comments, which are
arrays that respectively contain every token and every non-comment token. A token has both a type and a value. The
former is for categorizing which type of JavaScript syntax it is; the latter is the actual content.

Code_Widget

class Code_Widget

Code_Widget draws a DOM element containing a code navigator panel, with colorful syntax highlighting and with inline
links to the entire program source code. Clicking a linked class definition brings up that source code instead.
Code_Widget considers all definitions that exist within the namespaces called "tiny" and "defs" when converting
identifier names into links.

constructor( component, options = {} )

Pass in the Component that owns the document section this widget appears inside of. Option "code_in_focus" selects
which source code class, method, or function to display. Option "hide_navigator" hides the table of links to all
known code definitions appearing in namespaces "tiny" and "defs".

display_code( code_in_focus )

Populate the code textbox. Pass undefined to choose index.html's source as the code to display.

Editor_Widget

class Editor_Widget

Currently does not work offline. This class is for submitting modified class definition to online hosted repositories
of tiny-graphics demos. The button to refresh the demo with updated code is currently non-working.

constructor( component, options = {} )

Pass in the Component that owns the document section this widget appears inside of. Option "rows" determines the
maximum amount of rows in the input before line wrapping. Option "code_in_focus" selects which source code class,
method, or function to display.

select_class( class_definition )

Populates the editor textbox with an existing definition from source.

fetch_handler (url, body)

A general utility function for sending / receiving JSON, with error handling.
