class Controls_Widget

**Controls_Widget** adds an array of panels to the document, one per loaded
Scene object, each providing interactive elements such as buttons with key
bindings, live readouts of Scene data members, etc.

constructor( component, options = {} )

class Keyboard_Manager

**Keyboard_Manager** maintains a running list of which keys are depressed.  You can map combinations of
shortcut keys to trigger callbacks you provide by calling add().  See add()'s arguments.  The shortcut
list is indexed by strings, conveniently showing each bound shortcut combination.

constructor( target = document, callback_behavior = ( callback, event ) => callback( event ) )

The constructor  optionally takes "target", which is the desired DOM element for keys to be pressed
inside of, and "callback_behavior", which will be called for every key action to allow extra behavior
on each event -- giving an opportunity to customize their bubbling, preventDefault, and more.  It
defaults to no additional behavior besides the callback itself on each assigned key action.

add( shortcut_combination, callback = () => {}, keyup_callback = () => {} )

add(): Creates a keyboard operation.  The argument shortcut_combination wants an
array of strings that follow standard KeyboardEvent key names. Both the keyup
and keydown callbacks for any key combo are optional.

class Code_Manager

**Code_Manager** breaks up a string containing code (any ES6 JavaScript).  The RegEx being used
to parse is from https://github.com/lydell/js-tokens which states the following limitation:
"If the end of a statement looks like a regex literal (even if it isnâ€™t), it will be treated
as one."  (This can miscolor lines of code containing divisions and comments).

constructor( code )

class Code_Widget

**Code_Widget** draws a code navigator panel with inline links to the entire program source code.

constructor( component, options = {} )

display_code( code_in_focus )

display_code():  Populate the code textbox. Pass undefined to choose index.html source.

class Editor_Widget

constructor( component, options = {} )

select_class( class_definition )

fetch_handler (url, body)

A general utility function for sending / receiving JSON, with error handling.
